## 11/9/2025 - Overview of the past week  

# 11/1/2025 - Brainstorming
I originally came up with this idea after seeing RobertGcode's Quark printer, which fueled the inspiration to start work on a printer that may not perform the best, but was as compact as possible for the build volume it provided. I then looked into other works that I had remembered, such as the Fraxinus project which has printers such as the 00w, a 70mmx70mmx70mm build volume printer, and the 0w, a printer with 120mmx120mmx120mm build volume. When looking into what I wanted the requirements for this printer to be, I came up with a list:
- As compact as possible for given build volume
- Easy enclosing as needed
- Dedicated part cooling and a heated bed

The first and last requirements would prove rather difficult, as it would affect how the printer was packaged, and having the requirements of a heated bed would limit me to already designed sizes, such as the Voron V0's 120mmx120mm print bed or the 180mmx180mm bed of other printers, such as the Annex Engineering K3. Due to looking at the prices of the K3 beds, and the distinct lack of stock, I decided to go for a 120mmx120mm bed. As for the requirement of part cooling, this would require the fan to be mounted on the toolhead unlike all of the small printers at this size, which use auxiliary cooling mounted to the walls of the printer. From the end of this, I saw that all small printers used CoreXY kinematics so that was my original plan to use with this printer.
I then went into thinking about belt layouts for the gantry, along with how the toolhead would be integrated, as both would determine the outer dimensions of the frame, and each were dependent on one another.

At this stage I was still debating between having the rails mounted to the side walls versus mounting them on top of the walls, as it would affect packaging in multiple different ways. Eventually I settled on top mounted rails with a CoreXY motion system.

# 11/2/2025 - Initial Packaging

At the beginning of the second day, I had started to try and work out belt pathing for a CoreXY machine, but I ran into numerous problems. First of all, I would need to have two layers of belts, increasing the Z height, along with needing idler pulleys in some not so convenient spaces for toolhead motion. There would also need to be belts running along the back of the printer, decreasing the compactness. For these reasons, I started work on developing the printer with H-Bot kinematics. While this kinematics system is typically known for its issues with racking, I chose to use it due to its compactness. This would lead me to developing the current sketch for the gantry, which allows for the outer dimensions of the printer to be 177.4mm by 184mm without a chamber.

# 11/8/2025 - Initial Chassis Creation

I decided to start work on developing the chassis for the gantry to sit on, as it would roughly determine how much space I would have to fit all of the other components needed. This would also lead to many janky solutions to get around the compactness goals that I had for the printer, such as having the motors mounted low and not directly attached to any of the pulleys in the gantry.

# 11/9/2025 Creation of the Blueprint Journal/Github Repository

I decided that now was a good time to create the journal as I had mainly been putting it off and I started to realize that I would forget what I had done if I had started documenting it later.
